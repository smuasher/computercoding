##1. So far, I've begun learning python 3. I've been using the Harvard CS50 lectures to do so. So far, I've coded a "hello, world" program in python and have started trying to recreate a few simple projects from CSP in python (as opposed to C).

##2. Reflection questions
###a. My goal for this deliverable was to be able to do basic code in python, which I am able to do.
###b. Yes, I met this goal.
###c. In order to stay on schedule, I think I should begin my project within the next month and try and ask as many questions as possible in order to keep myself on track.

##3. My computer doesn't allow me to screen record, but when it does, I will upload a link of what I've done so far.
