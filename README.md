### Deliverable 2:
1. So far, I've begun learning python 3. I've been using the Harvard CS50 lectures to do so. So far, I've coded a "hello, world" program in python and have started trying to recreate a few simple projects from CSP in python (as opposed to C).
2. Reflection questions

⋅⋅a. My goal for this deliverable was to be able to do basic code in python, which I am able to do.

⋅⋅b. Yes, I met this goal.

⋅⋅c. In order to stay on schedule, I think I should begin my project within the next month and try and ask as many questions as possible in order to keep   myself on track

3. My computer doesn't allow me to screen record, but when it does, I will upload a link of what I've done so far.

### Deliverable 3:
1. Up until now, I’ve been learning the basic syntax of python through multiple resources like Google’s Python Class, Codecademy’s python course, and YouTube videos occasionally. 
2. My goal was to learn and understand how to use the syntax of basic Python. I did meet this goal.I don’t think I need any extra help or time to get my project done, I’m on track to finishing on time.

### Deliverable 4:
1. I’ve decided on my project and have a rough draft of it. I decided to make a rock-paper-scissors game; I coded a rough draft of it, meaning that it works, but only runs once and doesn’t have a nice introduction or send-off for the user. 
2. My goal was to get started working on my project, I met that goal and exceeded my expectations by essentially finishing my program.

### Deliverable 5:
1. For this deliverable, I didn’t learn anything new.
2. My goal was to polish the project, make it so that the program would continuously run if the user wanted. I did meet this goal.
